> My learning and working with various libraries and modules in python.

This repo contains codes for various libraries in python which I learn from different sources present online.

I have been learning python since my undergraduate course. **Python is love. Nothing can replace it.**
There are people who are doing wonderful job by teaching us lots of interesting topics and an infinite amount of blogs, videos and tutorials that has helped me in all these years.

Please visit their blogs/channels and appreciate them.

I would like to thanks my friends and colleagues who shared their online courses with me to learn.

> Happy Coding. Love Python.
